## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `back-strapi`

The assets directory contains your backend strapi such as sqlite database, configurations, api's etc.

More information about the usage of this directory in [strapi](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start).

### `front-nuxt`

The assets directory contains your frontend nuxtjs framework such as vuetify, axios, api calling, modules etc.

More information about the usage of this directory in [nuxt2](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets) and [vuetify2](https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/).
